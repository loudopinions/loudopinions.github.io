title: Why Would Anyone Want to Publish Their Opinions on the Internet?

Certainly no good can come of it. 

### And Why Pay Money for a Domain When You Could Put Them on Medium or Twitter or Facebook or Instagram or <BLOG PLATFORM> for Free????

* Certainly no good can come of it.
* Having one's own site means one can say "as I recently wrote on my blog..." and then talk about my blog which everyone appreciates EVEN MORE than they appreciate being told about your podcast
* It is only twelve (12) dollars 
* One joins the élite company of many famous and handsome bloggers
* Setting it up was actually p easy (it is a Jekyll blog hosted on GitHub pages using the Hyde theme s/o to the dude making the Hyde theme the docs are only slightly confusing and only a lil out of date and it's a good theme Brent)
* Time and space to expand on subjects one cares about
* If I post something sufficiently stupid, no one will ever hire me again
* IDK. I don't really read anyone else's blogs. But maybe everyone will find mine and fall in love (with the blog, not me).
* Wanting to give back to the internet a bit. Contributing instead of just consuming. 
* Jekyll respects nice characters like é and probably other nice unicode, and one can write in Markdown, which is a lovely way to create #content
